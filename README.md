<h1>Happy Number Finder</h1>
<h2>The aim of this project is to make a program that can find all the happy numbers between a specified range.</h2>
<h2>A happy number is a number that eventually reaches 1 when the sum of the squares of each comprising digit is taken and added together. This process repeats until the number eventually reaches one or it doesn't.
